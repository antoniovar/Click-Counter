# ⚛️ React Click Counter ⚛️
This is a simple click counter made with React.

I did it like a part of FreeCodeAcademy React's course just to understand some React's bases like Hooks (useState()). The code is in spanish and without comments because I was following and understanding the steps, but not coding by myself.
